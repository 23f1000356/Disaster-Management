   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\royvi\Desktop\Climate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

If your main frontend is inside `acdms-dashboard/`, use:
   ```powershell
   cd acdms-dashboard
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
